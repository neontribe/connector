{-
   To make a paragraph use CopyText and just write out your paragraph in the following "quotation marks"

       CopyText "This is a paragraph or title. Easy!"

       Also use CopyText with empty "" if you don't want anything there.

       CopyText ""


   To make a list (such as bulletpointed information) use CopyList. Wrap your list [in square brackets],  write each of your list items
   "contained in its own quotation marks" and follow each with a comma

       CopyList
           [ CopyText "Please"
           , CopyText "Don't forget to write"
           , CopyText "Lists like"
           , CopyText "This"
           ]


   To make a paragraph that has a link in the text, use CopyWithLink. There are four components to CopyWithLink: the text that comes before the link,
   the words that will comprise the link itself, the web address you want the text to link to, and any text that comes after the link.

       CopyWithLink
           { textBefore = "This is a paragraph that contains"
           , linkText = "a link"
           , destination = "https://www.google.co.uk"
           , textAfter = "to Google's home page."
           }

   To add multiple bits of copy to a single section use CopySection. The items in the the section will appear with space between them.

       CopySection
           [ CopyText
           , CopyList
           , CoptText
           ]
